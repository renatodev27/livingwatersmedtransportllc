            We can transport by ambulance or stretcher van for your medical transport needs, and some services may be covered 
            by Medicare and/or your insurance provider.  We are also able to transport you to the ER by ambulance, and in 
            most cases we can bill your insurance.  Transportation by stretcher is the preferred method for most long distance 
            medical transports due to the relaxed position of the body, when compared to sitting up in a wheelchair or car seat 
            for any length of time. <br>
            Let Living Waters Medtransport LLC Transport assist you with your needs when this is required.
            <br><br>
            For routine doctor's appointments, our stretcher van service is provided at the fraction of the cost of an ambulance.
            Our patients are accompanied by specially trained personnel including an attendant and a driver.  Our vehicles are 
            new and concierge-style service is unmatched so your safety and comfort are well looked after throughout 
            your entire journey. Feel secure and comfortable with Living Waters Medtransport LLC.
            <br><br>
