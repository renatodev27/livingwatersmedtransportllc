            Our wheelchair vans accommodate both manual and powered wheelchairs, and have hydraulic lifts so the patient never 
            has to leave the comfort of their chair. Family members no longer need to struggle loading a heavy wheelchair into 
            the trunk and risking injuring to themselves or the patient when transferring into a private car. 
            <br><br>
            Instead, our professionally trained drivers will safely take your loved one straight to the appointment and 
            return when called or have a pre-scheduled pick-up time. All of our van are new, have tinted windows and raised 
            roofs for comfort, and have the safest five point wheelchair seatbelt and floor restraint system on the market 
            from Q'Straint.
            <br><br>
            The wheelchair patient must be capable of sitting up in the wheelchair for the duration of the time required in 
            order to request this service for transport.
